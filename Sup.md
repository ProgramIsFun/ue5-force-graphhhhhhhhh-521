      - Very cool effects with a lot of cubes. Seems to moving together in and out In a very large cube.

          - Use instantastic mesh and also compute shaders.

      - Not exactly compute shaders, but perhaps useful to Learn how to write good hlsl code.

      - To be inspected.

      - https://github.com/RyanSweeney987/UE5_Tut_3_Compute_Shaders
          - Is a plug-in

      - The repulsory is shared indirectly through a youtube comment, which linked to a Private website, which has a Github link. However, the USF file is missing.

  - https://github.com/Temaran/UnrealEngineShaderPluginDemo/tree/5.0
      - Almost everything is put in the plug in, including the Game mode and default pond blueprint.
          - It also add a call back to the render thread.
              -     OnPostResolvedSceneColorHandle = RendererModule->GetResolvedSceneColorCallbacks().AddRaw(this, &FShaderDeclarationDemoModule::PostResolveSceneColor_RenderThread);
                  - But for this time we call Compute shader first and then a pixel shader In this manually made callback function

      - 4.23
      - Does not implement OCTREE
      - The plug in could be disabled to start the project
      - Not a good example to reference.
  - https://github.com/UEEnthusiast/N-body-Simulation
      - Very very similar to the core of https://github.com/aleksandrbazhin/Unreal_2D_NBodySim/tree/master
  - https://github.com/aleksandrbazhin/Unreal_2D_NBodySim/tree/master
      - N-body simulation with Unreal Engine, 2500 bodies in realtime

      - N-body problem simulation with C++ and Unreal Engine 4
          - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J0xdB-CSnU&ab_channel=ShallowDive
      - The whole project could be converted to 5.3 unreal engine directly
      - In the function GravityStep, Which is supposed to update the velocity of all the Particle use a Parallel for loop.

  - https://github.com/martinpaule/DissertationProject/tree/main
      - A very cute looking game is made.
      - Unknown engine version is used.
      - Provide Executable  to run directly.
  - https://github.com/MatthisL/UE5_NBodySimulation
      - This use compute shaders That are enclosed in a plug in
      - Use instance static mesh.
